NAME

pyselenium - productive Web UI testing

Test webapps lean in any browser with Selenium and Python

SETUP

pick 1 of 3 choices: Cygwin, Windows, Linux RH/Centos

Cygwin: (best unix/mac like productive choice on windows)
------------------

1. download Cygwin:
http://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe
2. run command in dos cmd window:
setup-x86_64.exe -q -P nc,wget,vim,git,subversion,openssh,python3
3. prefix Windows system PATH with:
c:\cygwin64\bin;

4. Run command in Cygwin terminal:

cd; git clone http://dkrukov@irepo.eur.ad.sag/scm/~dkrukov/pyselenium.git && cd pyselenium
./install_pyse_cygwin

------------------

Setup on Windows (not as optimal):
------------------
1. install [python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads)

2. install selenium module using command:
python -m pip install selenium==3.3.1

3. prepend system env PATH variable with the following:

%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts\;%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\;c:\cygwin64\bin;

Note: adjust PATH elements above for your version of python

4. add PYTHONPATH=src system env variable

5. ensure git package is installed

6. git clone http://dkrukov@irepo.eur.ad.sag/scm/~dkrukov/pyselenium.git

------------------

Setup on Linux RH/Centos:
------------------

1. ensure git package is installed
2. Run command:
cd; git clone http://dkrukov@irepo.eur.ad.sag/scm/~dkrukov/pyselenium.git && cd pyselenium
./install_pyse_rh

------------------

On any platform - Install browsers support and optional hub (to run tests like on remote hub):

------------------

1. install ie, firefox, chrome, edge browsers as needed

2. Install browers' drivers and selenium hub

./hub install

2. Optional - you may also launch hub on your local for test purposes:
   to run Selenium hub use one of these commands:

./hub		#starts hub and node
./hub hub	#starts just hub
./hub node	#starts just node which points to local hub
./hub node host:port	#starts just node, which points remote host:port hub; standard port is 4444

-----------------

Optional: On a dedicated host(s) around, install hub and nodes(as needed):
-----------------
wget http://irepo.eur.ad.sag/users/dkrukov/repos/pyselenium/raw/hub && chmod 755 hub

   to run Selenium hub use one of these commands:

./hub		#starts hub and node
./hub hub	#starts just hub
./hub node	#starts just node which points to local hub
./hub node host:port	#starts just node, which points remote host:port hub; standard port is 4444

USAGE

run DEMO for KPI Creation Gadget

cd ~pyselenium
./t/kpi_creation_demo

IDE is optional, your choise of productivity

TODO

a few more DEMO tests

How to build full blown very focused complex feature test


WE NOW CAN

- do lots of tests which are just as simple and informal to use as shown above

- focus on building a very specific feature tests rather than object abstraction towers

- start coding far deep down under well implemented thin functional layers of UI navigation

- utilize imperative/functional composition test design, rather than object oriented bloater

- do all tests tiny (a few lines), razor sharp focused on 1 thing done very well, lightning fast (run for 30-60s or so)

- principally - no state, and concurrency horror

- enjoy breezy maintanance

- run and tune tests on all 3 (or more) browser types equally

- run and tune tests under stress load conditions on beefy hub or local -no special arrangement or effort needed

- document TC steps natural and ordered as they are rather than typical ladder of object hierarchy utopia

- bundle tests up into arbitrary sized sets, loop and run it all parallel with simple scripts

- stop using clumsy prop, csv, xls, xml, whatever config files

- pass json snippets in env vars - it just works for ~all small, complex layered or iterative config needs

- "tooling", "frameworking", "ide-ing", dependencies and so on - a taste thing and is not mandatory whatsoever
